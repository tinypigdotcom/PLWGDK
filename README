
PLWGDK - Perl Light-Weight Game Development Kit
===============================================

This is a framework I am creating to teach my children how to program.
It is my hope that it will become something others can use as well.


Philosophy
----------
Learning to program at its core is learning how to give a list of
instructions to a computer.  Learning software development the
traditional way (Hello, World example, What is your name? example, etc)
is boring. I want to create a way to learn that provides instant visual
feedback.  We tried Alice but it did not keep the boys' interest.


Starting
--------
Circles is a good start, but what game are we working toward creating?
A real game should be goal #1, with fine-tuning of that game as later
chapters, then creation of other games.


Clone ideas
-----------
* Asteroids!
* Space Invaders
* Pac Man
* Galaxian
* Match 3
* Breakout


Components
----------
A complete learning solution should include:
* Full documentation
    * lessons in text / text & images / video formats
    * full API documentation
* A web presence with ability to allow people to contribute
* Compliance with Perl standards
    * Perl::Critic


My Learning Goals
-----------------
Peripheral things it might be appropriate for me to learn during this
process:
* Git
* Github
* Moose
* Different game development theories / approaches / frameworks
